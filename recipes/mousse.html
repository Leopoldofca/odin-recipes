<p><strong>How to make Chocolate mousse</strong></p>
<p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Crust:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>21 chocolate sandwich cookies, crushed</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Filling:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups heavy cream, divided</li>
            <li>1 (12-ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Topping:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream, chilled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Step-by-Step</strong></p>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4-inch sides.

Make crust: Mix together crushed cookies and butter in a medium bowl until well combined. Press mixture evenly into the prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.

Make filling: Combine 1 cup cream, chocolate chips, vanilla, and salt in the top of a double boiler. Heat, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is fully melted and mixture is smooth. Pour chocolate mixture into a large bowl; cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.

Beat 2 cups cream in a second large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold into chocolate mixture until well combined. Pour mixture into cooled crust. Chill pie in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours before topping and serving.

Make topping: Beat chilled cream and sugar with an electric mixer in a medium bowl until stiff. Pipe onto the top of pie with a star tip, or spoon dollops onto each slice to serve.
